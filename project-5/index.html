                JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language,
                 supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                additional objects; for example:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                    another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                    server.

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
                    (WWW).
                  </li>
                  <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                  <li>
                    Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
                    one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
                  </li>

        <section id="Hello_world">
       <h2>Hello World</h2>
       <article>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
        your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        <code
          >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>

        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!

        <section id="Variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
                rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
